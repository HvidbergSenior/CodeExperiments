It is calculated from the GHG emissions intensity (gCO2e/MJ) of fuel supply chain data (as supplied on the RFAS Renewable Fuel Declaration) and the LHV of the renewable fuel or blend. \n" +

  fossibleFuelComparatorDescription:
    "Knowing how to compare emissions of biofuels to their fossil fuel counterpart is extremely important as using different comparators could give vastly different emission reduction results. When comparing B100 Biodiesel RME and HVO100 Renewable Diesel used in the transport sector, the standard fossil comparison is pure diesel (i.e. 100 % diesel), which releases 94 grams of CO2eq per megajoule or about 3300 grams of CO2eq per liter combusted.\n\n Different sectors have their own fossil fuel comparator as listed below:",
