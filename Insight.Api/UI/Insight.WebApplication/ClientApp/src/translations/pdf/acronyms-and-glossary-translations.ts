  defGHG:
    "Greenhouse gases, so named because their ability to contain heat if accumulated in a large enough scale is similar to that of a greenhouse, are generated in plentiful ways all around us â€“ most through land use (agriculture) and combustions in production facilities. The most common ones are carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), although there are more hazardous ones in the form of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). As far as reporting standards go, these are often collectively expressed as CO2-equivalents, but, if possible, the GHG Protocol states that these gases should be reported individually as well.",
