  ghgReportProcedureTitle:
    "The standardized GHG reporting procedure according to the GHG Protocol",
  ghgReportProcedureTitleDescription:
    "For the end user of biofuels, it is common practice to categorize net emissions from biofuels as biogenic and report these separately from the scopes according to the GHG protocol (see chapter 9, page 63 of A corporate accounting and reporting standard by the GHG Protocol). This is done to differentiate reported fossil-based and bio-based CO2 emissions respectively. \n\nFurthermore, while the life cycle CO2 emission values presented on the PoS gives great insight into the carbon intensity of different stages of our products life cycle, the actual value that should be reported (as biogenic scope 1 emissions) is the net positive emissions value, i.e. the last line on the left on the PoS. Doing otherwise might result in double-counting, meaning that emissions and/or emission reductions are reported twice by the reporting entities along the value chain.",
