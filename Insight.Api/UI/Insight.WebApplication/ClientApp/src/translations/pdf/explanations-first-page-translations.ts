  supplyChainDescriptionPartOne:
    "Life cycle GHG emissions account for the collection and processing of biomass waste feedstocks, the transportation to the biofuel production plant, the manufacturing of biofuel, the distribution of biofuel to the market, and its use in a vehicle (combustion).",
  supplyChainDescriptionPartTwo:
    "For the transport sector, the life cycle analysis Well-to-wheel (WTW) is often used to determine the emissions from vehicle usage by including the life cycle of the used fuel but excluding the production and the end-of-life phase of the vehicle. The end goal is, for each step in the biofuel supply chain illustration above, to account for all CO2eq emissions, and emission reductions, that the product gives rise to.",
  supplyChainDescriptionPartThree:
    "Well-to-tank (WTT) is the first stages of a product’s life cycle, where extraction, production and distribution take place, whereas tank-to-wheel (TTW) is the final stage of a product’s life cycle. For fuel products, this means some sort of combustion phase where energy is generated, and emissions released. In the transport sector, TTW is the same as tailpipe emissions.",
